In the last few years many of the problems with CSS have been mitigated by adding a layer in between the declaration of the styles and the rendering of the styles. In the early days it was through esoteric preprocessor languages and today it is through CSS-in-JS. This library is my attempt to build on the current CSS-in-JS landscape and create the API for writing CSS that I've always wanted. I can honestly say that I've got pretty close to my happy place and even if you don't think this is for you, hopefully you'll find the approach interesting. It started out as an experiment, but I'm now using it in a few projects and finding it a joy to use.

## Who Is This For?

If you use a CSS-in-JS solution and want to write less and more consistent CSS, then this library might be for you. I think will prove very useful even if it's just you working on a project, but across a team it has the potential for greatly improving consistency and work-flow. Apart from a variety of useful functionality it gives you a single location for a single source of truth, and that alone can be a great boon.

There are already some great libraries that do something similar, but I found them all lacking in one respect or another. 

There are a few important factors which guided my decisions in designing it.

* I don't believe that setting styles on a component via its props is the answer. In fact I think it is an anti-pattern.
* I believe that even if you are using an AP on top of CSS, things should be named as you expect, and not in the form of some DSL that you have to mentally map to the style it will effect.
* Not everyone wants the same features, so make sure it is easily extended and customisable.
* Embrace the potential offered by JavaScript to the maximum.

CSS isn't going to get any better any time soon, so this is my attempt at making it less painful to use. 

## What Does It Look Like?

Here is an example using cssapi when defining a styled-component:

```javaScript
import { scope } from 'cssapi'
import api from '../../config/cssapi'

const Title = styled.h2`
  ${api({
    font: `font:title`,
    padding: scope`1ru`,
    baseline: `scale:medium 3`,
    background: `image:paperTexture gradient:gentleFade`,
  })}
`
```

## Installation

```bash
yarn add cssapi
```

## Overview

CSSAPI comprises of a configuration layer, an API layer, and some helpers to make working with themes easier. If you want to get an idea of what is offered by the api first, skip forward, then come back to the configuration section.

### Configuration

The first thing you need to do is define the API and export it for use throughout your application. `cssapi` exports a default function, and calling it will return an api function.

```JavaScript
import configureCssApi from 'cssapi'

// Create your api function
const api = configureCssApi()

// Export the api function for use in your application
export default api
```

If you call `configureCssApi` with no arguments you will get the default configuration, which you can take a look in `src/config/defaultConfig.js`. This configuration enables lots of functionality out of the box, but doesn't define any breakpoints.

Lets take a look at a custom configuration:

```JavaScript
const breakpoints = [
  [`smallUp`, 400],
  [`mediumUp`, 1000],
  [`largeUp`, 1400],
]

const api = configureCssApi({
  breakpoints,
  data: {
    rhythm: 24,
    baseline: {
      lineHeight: 24,
    },
    color: {
      red: `#EE0`,
      danger: `color:red`,
    },
    font: {
      shrikhand: `shrikhand`,
      helvetica: `helvetica`,
      title: `font:shrikhand Sans-Serif`,
      body: `font:helvetica Sans-Serif`,
    },
    scale: {
      body: 14,
      primary: 22,
    },
    scopes: {
      resolve: [mediumUp],
      rhythm: 28,
      baseline: {
        lineHeight: 28
      },
      scale: {
        body: 18,
        primary: 26,
      },
    }
  }
})
```

In this configuration we define a series of breakpoints. Here we are using unitless numbers which will be interpreted as pixel values, but ultimately all breakpoints will be rendered using ems. This library handles the conversion for you.

Next we define a data object. This object describes values we will use in our application. As you can see, values can be a simple key-value pair or an object. `rhythm` is setting a unit to use throughout the application when defining things like padding or margin. Instead of using distance values, you can use rhythm units, for example `2ru` would map to `48`. This lets you think about your layout in a more abstracted and consistent way. It also allows you to change the layout of an entire application by tweaking a single value. `baseline` defines the baseline used for displaying text. Later you will see that you can define `text-size` and `line-height` using a helper. `baseline` has other properties that you can tweak so it is defined as an object. If we wanted to set other values we would add those key-value pairs. `color` declares a map of colour values. Although we define colours here, we can also define mapping by using tokens. For obvious reasons it isn't good referring to colours by such a direct naming, so we abstract it through the use of a token. You will see how to use tokens later, but this token tells the library to replace the token with a lookup to 'color.red`. We do the same with our fonts and as you can see we define a font-stack, and the tokens within the string will be replaced by the font names we have defined. We then define a font-scale, again insulating our actual values through the use of naming.

Finally we define a `scopes` object. This allows us to change values at any of the breakpoints we have defined, so here we are saying 'From medium up, increase both `rhythm` and `baseline` values to 28. As you will see next, this allows the library to generate most media queries for you with minimum configuration. We also define a different font scale, scaling text up for larger screens.

### Use

Once we have created an api, we can use it anywhere in a component by calling the `api` function with an object of declarations. A declaration is effectively just a CSS declaration, but made via our api, allowing us to do lots of things that wouldn't be possible using pure CSS. Note: here we are just importing the api object, but the library also supports delivery of the api through a component's theme.

```JavaScript
import { scope } from 'cssapi'
import api from '../../config/cssapi'

const Title = styled.h2`
  ${api({
    font: `font:title`,
    padding: {
      default: `1ru`,
      mediumUp: `2ru`,
    },
    baseline: scope`scale:primary`,
  })}
`
```

Here are the styles that will be rendered:

```css
font-family: shrikhand Sans-Serif;
padding: 1.5625rem;
font-size: 1.375rem;
line-height: 1.5rem;

@media (min-width: 62.5em) {
  padding: 3.5rem;
  font-size: 1.625rem;
  line-height: 1.75rem;
}
```

As you can see, all values have been converted to rems. Our font stack has been rendered. `baseline` has rendered both a `font-size` based on the scale we defined and a `line-height` based on the value we configured for `baseline`.

Our padding has been rendered using the `rhythm` values we defined, and we wanted the amount of padding to double at our `mediumUp` breakpoint. However, because we defined a different value for `rhythm` in our scope for that breakpoint, it will double _that_ value.

`font-size` has been rendered using the scale we defined, however crucially, we tagged it using `scoped`. This tells the library that it should use the values you have supplied for scopes to automatically generate queries for each breakpoint. This means you can set a single value and be sure it will be rendered across all your breakpoints _using the value appropriate for that breakpoint_.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Please work through the following documentation to better understand what you can do.

## Docs

### Configuration

Throughout this library, validation is used where possible to generate useful errors if you supply invalid or incorrect values. So make sure you read any error messages as they will help you divine what's gone wrong. If you receive unhelpful errors, please open an issue so I can make sure they are more useful.

#### `createApi`

To start working with this library you need to create an api function. The function takes an object as its single argument. This object does a few important things:

- Describes your application's breakpoints
- Describes settings for use in creating CSS
- Describes simple or complex values to use in creating CSS
- Describes the kinds of transformations you want to perform on CSS values
- Configures aliases for token values used in your CSS declarations

You can see the default configuration in `src/config/defaultConfig.js`. Any configuration you supply will be merged with the default configuration.

You create the api function as follows: 

```JavaScript
import configureCSSAPI from 'cssapi'

const config = {
  â€¦
}

const api = configureCssApi(configuration)
```

The configuration object is broken into three sections:

##### 1. Breakpoints

Breakpoints should be supplied as an array of arrays. Each array item should include two values:

- The name of the breakpoint
- The value of the breakpoint:

```JavaScript
const breakpoints = [
  [`smallUp`, `25em`],
  [`mediumUp`, `50em`],
  [`largeUp`, `75em`],
]

const config = {
  breakpoints,
}

```

The value can either be a unitless number (in pixels), or an em value as a string. Whichever you choose, media queries will be rendered using ems. Breakpoint order is important and values should run from low to high. There is no limit on the number of breakpoints you want to use, but as you'll see later, there is a mechanism for creating relative breakpoints (basically tweakpoints), so these breakpoints should represent the primary breaks in your application. The fewer the better. You should not define a `default` breakpoint. This will be handled automatically.

##### 2. Data

Data supplies values that will be used in transforming CSS values and each piece of data will be used by one or more transformers.

###### Layout Settings

`lengthUnit` defines what unit will be used for outputting length values. The default is `rem` units, but you can change this to `px` or `em`.

`baseFontSize` should be set to the root-most font size of your application. By default browsers will have a root font size of `16`. If you change it for any reason you will need to change it here as well, so that calculations converting `px` values to `rem` values produce the expected results. 

`rhythm` defines a special unit for use throughout your application. When you supply values to the api function, you can use `ru` units which will resolve to multiples of this value. You can use these units to abstract your thinking about spacing within the application, allowing you to think in rhythm units rather than explicit distance values. This also means you have control over your application's whitespace from a single location.

`baseline` provides you with a set of three configuration options which will control how the `baseline` helper will work. The idea behind the use of a baseline is that you set type to multiples of a constant baseline to ensure a consistent vertical rhythm.

- `lineHeight` defines the height of a single line.
- `minLeading` defines the minimum difference between `font-size` and the `line-height` before the space is considered too tight and a new line is added.
- `allowHalfLines` toggles whether whole or half-lines should be used when deciding on the number of lines needed to accommodate text. Setting this to `true` (the default), is more forgiving in cases where a `font-size` is only marginally larger than `line-height`.

###### Maps

Maps store values that you want to access from within your application. When you are defining styles, you will use tokens to describe lookups, for example to get a colour you would use a token that looks like this: `color:primary`. Each map also supports aliases, for example `color` has an alias of `c` so you can use `c:primary`. By default the library supports the following maps:

- `color`, (alias of `c`)
- `gradient`, (alias of `g`),
- `scale`, (alias of `s`),
- `boxShadow`, (alias of `d`),
- `border`, (alias of `b`),
- `image`, (alias of `i`),
- `font`, (alias of `f`)

There is no enforcement of what values you place in these maps.

You can use tokens within the maps themselves to refer to other values within the same map or within different maps. For example, here we define a `color` and `gradient` map:

```JavaScript
const config = {
  data: {
    color: {
      red: `#FD0000`,
      darkRed: `#931111`,
      danger: `color:red`,
      dangerDark: `color:darkRed`
    },
    gradient: {
      warning: `linear-gradient(color:danger, color:dangerDark)`
    }
  }
}
```

It is easy to add further maps if you find there are other types of values you want to include. 

###### Scopes

Scope is one of the most powerful features in the library. It allows you declare values that change at a given breakpoint. As you will see later, when combined with breakpoint generation, this can automate a lot of your style declarations. You absolutely do not have to use scopes, but you'll find can make your CSS much more declarative amd greatly reduce repetition.

You can declare data values again within a new scope. Each scope consists of an object with two keys:

- `resolve` is an array of breakpoint names
- `data` is a map of data values

In the following example we declare a default `rhythm` value of `20`, then two scopes. One to cover the breakpoints `smallUp` and `mediumUp`, and another to cover `largeUp`. When we ask the library to resolve a value for a particular breakpoint, it will use the appropriately scoped value. 

```JavaScript
const config = {
  data: {
    rhythm: 20,
    scopes: [
      {
        resolve: [`smallUp`, `mediumUp`],
        data: {
          rhythm: 24,
        },
      },
      {
        resolve: [`largeUp`],
        data: {
          rhythm: 28,
        },
      },
    ],
  }
}
```

###### Aliases

As outlined above, you can define a map of aliases. The default configuration defines them as follows:

```JavaScript
const config = {
  data: {
    aliases: {
      c: `color`,
      g: `gradient`,
      s: `scale`,
      d: `boxShadow`,
      b: `border`,
      i: `image`,
      f: `font`,
    },
  }
}
```

##### Properties

Properties define how each css property should be transformed and add new helpers that are available alongside the standard CSS properties. You can override any of the properties defined here or add your own transformers or helpers to change the api available to you. 

### API

The api is a simple one, consisting of a handfull of functions:

#### `api()` 

The api function itself is your main entry point. It accepts a single object which must be a map of declarations. The library will process these declarations and return the rendered CSS. The API supports most commonly used CSS properties and the default config defines how values supplied to these properties should be transformed. 

You can supply any valid css value to these declarations. The value(s) will be run through a series of transformations which will decide if they need to transform the value or not. If the value is already a valid CSS value it will be passed through untouched, however if the transformer detects a value that it knows how to transform, it will act on that value.

For any declaration that supports a CSS Length value you can supply a unitless value (in pixels) and it will be transformed into your chosen output value (defaults to `rem`). If a value uses `ru` units, for example `2.5ru` it will be transformed to your chosen rhythm unit. 

You can also use tokens in property values and they will be looked up in the maps you defined in your configuration's data. 

`calc` is supported and values within will be parsed. There are also transformers in place for dealing with gradients, transforms and urls, and values declared within all will be parsed and transformed.

Important note: You should only use `api` for values that need to be transformed as each use incurs an overhead. Any values that don't need to be looked up, transformed or wrapped in a query should be declared using standard CSS.

##### Basic Values

Here is an example of passing in rhythm units:

```JavaScript
api({
  padding: `1ru`,
  margin: `2ru 1ru`
})
```

```css
padding: 1.25rem;
margin: 2.5rem 1.25rem
```

You can pass in a token and it will be transformed into the value stored in the relevant map defined in your config:

```JavaScript
api({
  color: `color:primary`,
  background: `gradient:smoothFade, image:paperTexture`,
})
```

```css
color: #F0AA12;
background: linear-gradient(#AAA, #FFAAB1), url('example.png')
```

##### Breakpoints

If we pass in an Array, those values will be used for consecutive breakpoints. Note that with array values, each media query target the range for that breakpoint except for the last value which will target the range from that breakpoint and up:

```JavaScript
api({
  padding: [`1ru`, `1ru 2ru`, `3ru ]
})
```

```css
@media (max-width: 24.99em) {
  padding: 1.25rem;
}

@media(min-width: 25em) and (max-width 49.99em) {
  padding: 1.25rem 2.5rem;
}

@media(min-width: 50em) {
  padding: 3.75rem;
}
```

If we pass in an object, we can select values for each breakpoint:

```JavaScript
api({
  padding: {
    default: `1ru`,
    largeUp: `2ru`,
  }
})
```

```css
@media (max-width: 24.99em) {
  padding: 1.25rem;
}

@media(min-width: 50em) {
  padding: 2.5rem;
}
```

However there is much more that we can do here by using modifiers. 

To generate a query targeting everything below a breakpoint:

```JavaScript
api({
  padding: {
    [`<mediumUp`]: `1ru`,
  }
})
```

To generate a query targeting everything above a breakpoint:

```JavaScript
api({
  padding: {
    [`>mediumUp`]: `1ru`,
  }
})
```

To generate a query targeting everything between two breakpoints:

```JavaScript
api({
  padding: {
    [`smallUp<largeUp`]: `1ru`,
  }
})
```

You can also use offsets by using `+` or `-` with a value (in pixels). This will offset the breakpoint value by the supplied amount, so the following would target everything above `smallUp` + `100px`.

```JavaScript
api({
  padding: {
    [`>smallUp+100`]: `1ru`,
  }
})
```

When the library processes breakpoints it batches them automatically and condenses sibling breakpoints with the same values into a single breakpoint. 

##### Scopes

If you have defined scopes for any values, the appropriate value will be used for the given breakpoint. If you are targeting a range that spans more than one scope, the value from the lowest scope will be used. In such cases it is your responsibility to use separate ranges to cover different scopes. The library offers a special helper for dealing with cases where you want to define a property once and have it automatically scoped across all your breakpoints. In the following example assume we have set a different `rhythm` of `28` in our config scoped to breakpoints `mediumUp` and `largeUp`. 

```JavaScript
import { scope } from 'cssapi'

api({
  padding: scope`1ru`,
})
```

```css
@media (max-width: 49.99em) {
  padding: 1.25rem
}
@media(min-width: 50em) {
  padding: 1.75rem;
}
```

As you can see, this allows you to completely decouple your declaration of a value from the implementation of breakpoints to render that value. 


#### mq()

The `api` function has two functions available as properties. The first is `mq` which allows you to declare breakpoints in a more traditional way. Values supplied will be resolved using any scopes defined for that breakpoint or range of breakpoints and rendered with the appropriate query.  

```JavaScript
api.mq('smallUp', {
  padding: `1ru`
})
```

Modifiers can be used here as well:

```JavaScript
api.mq('>smallUp+100', {
  padding: `1ru`
})
```

#### extend()

`extend` can be used to create a new api function based on a previous api function, but with any new values supplied merged. As you will see later, this is useful for defining theme-specific apis. 

```JavaScript
const newApi = api.extend({
  rhythm: 26,
})
```

### CSS Props and Helpers 

#### Props

There are too many props to list here, but most CSS you use in your day-to-day work should be covered. If you find a property that isn't, please open an issue or a PR adding it.


#### Helpers

As well as the standard CSS properties supported, the following helpers are also available. They are mostly self explanatory and will work with varying numbers of arguments if it makes sense. 

- *baseline* This is discussed earlier, setting `font-size` and `line-height`
- *paddingH*
- *paddingV*
- *marginH*
- *marginV*
- *borderH*
- *borderV*
- *offset* This is a shorthand for setting `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`
- *offsetV* This is a shorthand for setting `top`, `bottom`
- *offsetH* This is a shorthand for setting `right`, `left`
- *borderTopRadius*
- *borderRightRadius*
- *borderBottomRadius*
- *borderLeftRadius*

### Using Themes

When using `styled-components` I've found it useful to make the API function available to my components via a theme. The library offers an `api` helper to make that easier. Assuming I have added my api function to a theme and supplied it to a component via a `ThemeProvider`, I can use the `api` function access the function from within interpolations:

```JavaScript
import { api } from 'cssapi'

const Example = styled.div`
  ${api({
    padding: `1ru`,
  })}
`
```

Without this helper accessing the `api` function would be much more verbose:

```JavaScript
const Example = styled.div`
  ${props => props.theme.api({
    padding: `1ru`,
  })}
`
```

### Using your own transformers

You can use the configuration to declare your own transformers for any css properties, or add css properties yourself. To add a new property, just add a key to the config object's `properties` object. The value must be either a single transformer or an array of transformers. 

A transformer comprises of a predicate used to decide whether the transformer should be applied to a value, and a function that performs the transformation. If an array of transformers are supplied, the value will be run through each in the order they are are supplied, this allows a value to pass through multiple transformations. 

TODO: More docs about adding transformers. 

## Roadmap

* Add more helpers: namely improve definition and use of fonts.
* Performance: look at improving performance through memoisation.
